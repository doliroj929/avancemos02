## 🚀 Motivation

### Avancemos

The motivation behind this project is to foster local development and support the circular economy in provinces and municipalities by facilitating the exchange of knowledge and skills. This is achieved through a flexible payment model — cash, barter, or mixed — that connects people with basic or specialized knowledge and promotes collaboration in various activities, such as:

- 📖 **Classes and Training** (languages, tutoring, music, IT, etc.)
- 👶 **Caregiving** (children, elderly, companionship)
- 🏠 **Household Tasks** (cleaning, small repairs, gardening, cooking)
- 🐕 **Pet Care** (dog walking, pet sitting)
- 💆‍♂️ **Wellness and Health** (massage, yoga, personal training)
- 🎨 **Creativity and Design** (photography, graphic design, crafts)
- 💻 **Technology and Repairs** (computers, mobile phones)
- 🚚 **Transport and Moving** (small deliveries)
- 🎭 **Entertainment and Leisure** (magic shows, storytelling, tour guiding)
- 🌟 **Other Services**

Additionally, this project aims to help people discover and showcase the skills they can offer to their community. 🤝🌍
